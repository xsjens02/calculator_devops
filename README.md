This is a school project focused on DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.

The CI/CD pipeline is structured into three main stages:


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **----- Code Integration & Quality Assurance -----**

- Automated code integration to ensure stability and correctness.
    
- Unit tests, code coverage, and mutation testing.
    
- Static code analysis using SonarQube.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **----- Automated Deployment to Staging -----**

- The full application is deployed to a staging server.
    
- Database migrations are handled using Flyway, ensuring version control and automatic setup of required tables.


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **----- Testing & Performance Assurance -----**

- End-to-end testing using TestCafe.
    
- Load testing with K6 to ensure performance under stress.


### üõ†Ô∏è **----- Tech Stack -----**

- **Backend:** REST API (ASP.NET)
    
- **Frontend:** React Client
    
- **Database:** MariaDB


### üìå **----- Features -----**

This project implements a calculator with two modes:

- **Simple Calculator** ‚Äì Executes calculations without caching.
    
- **Cached Calculator** ‚Äì Stores previous calculations to improve performance.


Both calculators support:

- ‚úîÔ∏è Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

- ‚úîÔ∏è Prime number checking
